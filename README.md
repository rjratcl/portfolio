# Welcome to My Portfolio
Below are some projects I’ve enjoyed working on. They are designed to showcase some of my skills relating to various aspects of analysis, such as visualisation, modelling, statistics, and machine learning. To begin, I’ve provided a list of the examples of my work you can find in this repository. I hope you enjoy!
 
1. Imputing Missing Values with Machine Learning
2. Modelling and Visualizing Canada-US Trade Patterns
3. Visual Exploration of Poverty and Access to Food in Chicago
4. Estimating Demand for Air Travel

## [Visual Exploration of Poverty and Access to Food in Chicago](https://github.com/rjratcl/portfolio/tree/main/chicago-grocery-access)
This project visually explores the relationship between childhood poverty levels and access to food. Using shapefiles, [this R script](https://github.com/rjratcl/portfolio/blob/main/chicago-grocery-access/groceries_poverty.R) produces a [map of the City of Chicago](https://github.com/rjratcl/portfolio/blob/main/chicago-grocery-access/poverty_and_food.png). The map shows the childhood poverty density for each of Chicago’s neighbourhoods and plots a random sample of grocery stores on top of the city map. The aim of the visualization is to:
- Examine the correlation between poverty and access to food
- Visualize the distribution of poverty across city neighbourhoods
- Visualize the density of grocery stores across city neighbourhoods

Notes: Density refers to a ratio of the number of children classified as living in poverty and the size of the region. A random sample of grocery stores was used to reduce clutter that obscured readability and interpretability of the image.
