# Welcome to My Portfolio
Welcome! My name is Justin and I'm a quantitatively-driven economist and data professional with a Master's degree from the University of Chicago. I have demonstrated expertise in the theory and application of statistical and econometric modelling, causal inference, and data analysis. I have a proven track record of leading impactful research projects and communicating technical ideas to diverse audiences. I'm passionate about the intersections of economics, innovation, and competition, with a focus on exploring data-driven approaches to better understand digital platforms, market structure, and market demand.

Below are some projects I’ve enjoyed working on. They are designed to showcase some of my skills relating to various aspects of my data work and economic analysis, such as visualization, modelling, statistics, and machine learning. To begin, I’ve provided a list of projects and examples of my work found in this repository. I hope you enjoy!

## [Visual Exploration of Poverty and Access to Food in Chicago](https://github.com/rjratcl/portfolio/tree/main/chicago-grocery-access)
This project visually explores the relationship between childhood poverty levels and access to food. Using shapefiles, [this R script](https://github.com/rjratcl/portfolio/blob/main/chicago-grocery-access/groceries_poverty.R) produces a [map of the City of Chicago](https://github.com/rjratcl/portfolio/blob/main/chicago-grocery-access/poverty_and_food.png). The map shows the childhood poverty density for each of Chicago’s neighbourhoods and plots a random sample of grocery stores on top of the city map. The aim of the visualization is to:
- Examine the correlation between poverty and access to food
- Visualize the distribution of poverty across city neighbourhoods
- Visualize the density of grocery stores across city neighbourhoods

Notes: Density refers to a ratio of the number of children classified as living in poverty and the size of the region. A random sample of grocery stores was used to reduce clutter that obscured readability and interpretability of the image.
